# Colour Palette

_This simple Python-Tkinter app allows you to select a picture from your local file system and display an associated 6-colour palette. You can also make use of the ColourPalette module as an API for your own applications._

_ColourPalette applies KMeans algorithm on a picture in order to extract its most relevant colours._

## How to start üöÄ

_Naturally, first thing you need to do is cloning this repository!_

```
git clone https://github.com/javiermunooz/ColourPalette.git
cd ColourPalette
```

Check out **Installation** to learn more about how to make this application work.


### Prerequisites üìã

_You will need Python 3.6.8 or later. This application has only been tested on Windows 10, so there is no guarantee it will work on a different platform._


### Installation üîß

_I recommend setting up a Python virtual environment in order to run this application without interfering with your current Python environment_

_Execute the following commands_

```
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_Once finished, everything will be ready to launch the app!_ 

_When you are done with ColourPalette, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply typing_

```
deactivate
```

## Running ColourPalette ‚öôÔ∏è

_You will simply need to launch the app.py file_

```
python app.py
```

_In case you want to build your own application, here is an example of how to use ColourPalete:_

```
cp = ColourPalette(path='my_image.jpg', n_clusters=5)

# Gets a n-colours palette
codes, counts = cp.colour_palette()

# Gets the most frequent colour in your picture
peak, colour = cp.most_common()
```

### License üìÑ

_This project was built under MIT license, which basically means do whatever you want but don't forget to credit the original author! A short @javiermunooz will do the trick._
